The crontab file for users can be edited (the "normal" way) using the command:
$> crontab -e
Then, the default editor opens and the file can be changed.

To just check the contents of the crontab use the command:
$> crontab -l

***

The crontab file is located on /var/spool/cron/crontabs/<username>

***

To define a crontab from a file it is possible to use the command:
$> crontab -u <user> <file>
